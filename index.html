		<b>Gospel</b> originally meant the Christian message itself, 
	  	but in the 2nd century it came to be used for the books in which the message was set out. 
		The four canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John comprise the first four books of the New Testament of the Bible 
		and were probably written between AD 66 and 110. 
		All four were anonymous (the modern names were added in the 2nd century), 
		almost certainly none were by eyewitnesses, 
		and all are the end-products of long oral and written transmission, 
		They are a subset of the genre of ancient biography but ancient biographies should not be confused with modern ones, 
		and often included propaganda and kerygma (preaching); 
		yet while there is no guarantee that the events which they describe are historically accurate, 
		in the quest for the historical Jesus scholars believe 
		that it is possible to differentiate Jesus' own views from those of his later followers. 
		Scholars have a consensus on the general outline of Jesus' life found in the gospels. 
		and even certain other elements of of the gospels that are not considered to be certain, 
		are still considered "historically probable." 
		Many non-canonical gospels were also written, 
		all later than the four, and like them advocating the particular theological views of their authors.
